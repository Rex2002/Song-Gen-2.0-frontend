# Song Gen 2

This repository provides a React web app that can be used [here](https://rex2002.github.io/song-gen-2.0-frontend/#/).<br>

The consumed API is provided by [this](https://github.com/MalteRichert/Song-Gen-2.0-Backend) fork of the initial [Song Generator Project](https://github.com/Rex2002/songGenerator). The fork by [Malte Richert](https://github.com/MalteRichert) ditches the javaFX-based UI and provides a REST API to enable a simpler song generator experience on the web. <br>
<br>

Text generation is currently disabled for the time being because it requires significant resources that we can't provide with free-to-use hosting.<br>
